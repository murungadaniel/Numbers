The number of malaria tablets that were produced by a pharmaceutical company over a certain period was 213 587 915. Round off this number to the nearest hundreds of million.    To round off a number to the nearest hundreds of millions, we identify if the digit at the tens of millions place value is greater,less or equal to .  If the digit in the tens of millions place value is greater or equal to then add to the digit in the hundreds of million place value and replace the remaining digits with zeros.  If the digit in the tens of millions place value is less than then maintain the digit in the hundreds of million place value and replace the remaining digits with zeros.  Since the digit in the hundreds of millions place value is and the digit in the tens of millions place value is , we replace the digits on the right hand side of with zeros.

Fishermen across the country exported kg of fish in the first year. In the second year; the mass of fish decreased by kg. Work out the mass of fish that the fishermen exported in the second year:    First, subtract the decrease in mass of fish in the second year from the mass of fish in the first year.        3  10   2  10  6  10      5  6   2   5    -   7  3  2  7  3  8     3  8  3  0  5  3  7    If the digits in a column, starting from the right-hand side, result in a negative value when subtracted, you borrow from the first digit in the next column to the left..  The digit you borrow from will be reduced by 1, while the digit you borrow to will increase by 10. See the example above.  Therefore, the mass of fish the fisherman exported in the second year was kg.          Multiplication of whole number      1.

If the digit in the tens of millions place value is less than then maintain the digit in the hundreds of million place value and replace the remaining digits with zeros.  Since the digit in the hundreds of millions place value is and the digit in the tens of millions place value is , we replace the digits on the right hand side of with zeros.  Therefore, to the nearest hundred million becomes    "

Expressing composite numbers as a product of prime factors   Composite numbers are numbers that has more than two factors,meaning it can be divided evenly by numbers other than and itself.  Process of breaking a composite number is prime factorization and prime factorization expresses the number as the product of prime numbers.     Factors of composite numbers  Factors are numbers that can divide a given number without leaving a remainder.  Factors are also called divisors.  Tumaini school is planning a sports day and Kamau needs to organize students into equal-sized teams. There are students in his class. Kamau needs factors of to divide the students into equal teams so that no one is left out.  Since the factors of are and . It gives Kamau possible ways to divide the students into equally.    List all the factors of each of the following numbers.                     The factors of are     The factors of are         Exercise for Factors goes here.      Prime factors  A prime factor is a prime number that can divide a given number without a remainder.  Example in real life:  Okuse, an architect want to design a strong and beautiful classroom. To make sure the classroom is stable, Okuse use blocks of the strongest materials. Now, think of prime numbers as the strongest building block in mathematics such that if we want to know what the number is made of we break it down into it's prime factors.  Start with         Therefore, prime factors of are      1. As a class, count the number of chairs in all the rows and measure one side of the classroom in metres.  2.

Exercise for GCD goes here.     Least Common Multiple  The Least Common Multiple of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by two or more numbers without a reminder.  Example:  Murunga and Onyimbo have busy schedules but want to meet regularly for a football game. Murunga have free time every days and Onyimbo has free time every days. To find when they will both be free on the same day to play, we solve using LCM.  Therefore, we list the multiples of Murunga's free days: and Onyimbo's free days:   The common multiples are and the smallest commom multiple is .  Hence Muranga and Onyimbo will both be free on the th day to play football game.     1. In groups of students each, play a game such that if the first person gives a number the next person will add to the number and the third person will add to the number formed by the second person and so is the forth and fifth person.i.e if the first person chooses then the next numbers would be .  2. Write down the multiples of each numbers i.e multiples of  and the multiples of    3. Look at the lists of multiples of numbers formed and find the smallest multiple that appears in both lists which is the LCM. FOR example the LCM of and is .  4.Use the LCM to check if the number is divided by the original numbers i.e and which are all whole numbers . Hence is the LCM.  5. Share your work with other learners.      Find the LCM     Multiples of are   Multiples of are   The common multiples are   The least common multiple is   LCM of and is       Grade 7 pupils was preparing for a party and used a ribbon to decorate their classroom.

Consider a surveyor tasked with determining the side length of a square garden with an area of m . Since all sides of a square are equal, the surveyor needs to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, results in . This is where the concept of square roots comes into play.  To find the side length of the garden, the surveyor needs to determine the square root of . In this case, the square root of is since , meaning each side of the garden is m long.  We can represent this mathematically as follows:       A square garden   A square with side length a        Area of a square = side length side length     , where represents the side length of the square.

Then, identify and count all the larger squares, such as  , and so on, until you reach the largest square that fits within the grid.    Write down the number of squares for each size in a table for better organization. Add them up to find the total number of squares in the grid.    Discuss your findings with a in a small group. Compare how many squares each of you found and check for any missed squares.    Think about the process you used to count the squares.
