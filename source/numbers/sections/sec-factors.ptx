    <title>Factors</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
      A factor is a number that can be multiplied to create a specific number in math.     
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, A group of <m>12</m> grade <m>7</m> students wanted to share <m>24</m> cookies equally. To find it out, they looked at the factors of <m>24</m>:1,2,3,4,6,8 and 24. They realized they could split the cookies into: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>2</m> cookies each for the <m>12</m> people.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>4</m> cookies each for the <m>6</m> people.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>6</m> cookies each for the <m>2</m> people.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors helped them share the cookies fairly among themselves.

                The number <m>47\,164</m> is divisible by <m>2</m> because the digit in the ones place value is an even number.

        <title>Divisibility test for 3</title>
            <p>
                A number is divisible by <m>3</m> if the sum of its digits gives a number that is divisible by <m>3</m>.

                Esther bought <m>12</m> mangoes and needs to divide them amoung her <m>3</m> children. She wondered if she can share the mangoes equally amoung her children.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since adding <m>12</m> gives <m>3</m> i.e <me> 1+2 = 3</me> hence <m>12</m> is divisible by <m>3</m> and Esther will share the mangoes equally among the children.

                                Since <m>67</m> is not divisible by <m>4</m> hence <m>289\,367</m> is not divisible by <m>4</m>

                Since the factors of <m>24</m> are <m>1,2,3,4,6,8,12</m> and <m>24</m>. It gives Kamau possible ways to divide the students into equally.

            <title>Prime factors</title>
            <p>
                A prime factor is a prime number that can divide a given number without a remainder.
            </p>
            <p>
            Example in real life:
            </p>
            <p>
             Okuse, an architect want to design a strong and beautiful classroom. To make sure the classroom is stable, Okuse use blocks of the strongest materials. Now, think of prime numbers as the strongest building block in mathematics such that if we want to know what the number <m>60</m> is made of we break it down into it's prime factors.
            </p>
            <p>
             Start with <m>60 = 2 \times 30</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>30 = 2 \times 15</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>15 = 3 \times 5</m>
            </p>
            <p>
               Therefore,  prime factors of <m>60</m> are <m>2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5</m>
            </p>

                    1. As a class, count the number of chairs in all the rows and measure one side of the classroom in metres.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    2. Write down the total number of chairs in a row then the measurement of the side of a class in meters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    3. Use factor trees to perform prime factorization on the two numbers. i.e prime factors of <m>36 = 2^2 \times 3^2</m>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    4. Write the prime factorization as a product of powers and share your work with fellow learners.

        <title>Greatest Common Divisor</title>
        <p>
            GCD is the greatest number that exactly divides two or more numbers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also known as the Highest Common Factor (HFC).
        </p>
        <p>
        Example in real life:
        </p>
        <p>
        Esther and Shillah have packets of snacks and want to share them equally amoung the top mathematics performers in grade <m>7</m> without leaving leftovers. Esther have <m>36</m> crackers and Shillah has <m>54</m> cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The largest number of top performers Shillah and Esther can gift is solved using GCD.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since the factors of <m>36</m> are <m>1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36</m> and the factors of <m>54</m> are <m>1,2,3,6,9,18,27,54</m>. This implies that the higher number of top performers to be gifted is <m>18</m>.

        <title>Least Common Multiple </title>
        <p>
            The Least Common Multiple of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by two or more numbers without a reminder.

        </p>
        <p>
        Example:
        </p>
        <p>
        Murunga and Onyimbo have busy schedules but want to meet regularly for a football game. Murunga have free time every <m>12</m> days and Onyimbo has free time every <m>18</m> days. To find when they will both be free on the same day to play, we solve using LCM.
        </p>
        <p>
        Therefore, we list the multiples of Murunga's free days: <m>12,24,36,48,60,72,...</m> and Onyimbo's free days: <m>18,36,54,72,90,...</m>
        </p>
        <p>
        The common  multiples are <m>36,72</m> and the smallest commom multiple is <m>36</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
           Hence Muranga and Onyimbo will both be free on the <m>36</m> th day to play football game.
        </p>
        <activity>
            <statement>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                1. In groups of <m>5</m> students each, play a game such that if the first person gives a number the next person will add <m>2</m> to the number and the third person will add <m>3</m> to the number formed by the second person and so is the forth and fifth person.i.e if the first person chooses <m>6</m> then the next numbers would be <m>8,11,15,20</m>  .
                </p>
                <p>
                2. Write down the multiples of each numbers i.e multiples of <m>6 = </m> <m>6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54...</m> and the multiples of <m>8 = </m> <m>8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,...</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                3. Look at the lists of multiples of numbers formed and find the smallest multiple that appears in both lists which is the LCM. FOR example the LCM of <m>6</m> and <m>8</m> is <m>24</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                4.Use the LCM to check if the number is divided by the original numbers i.e <me>24 \div 6 = 4 </me> and <me>24 \div 8 =3 </me> which are all whole numbers . Hence <m>24</m> is the LCM.
                </p>
